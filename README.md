## Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## Description:
MY task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. I've writen a unit test for every part of my code to ensure that it passes each test.
